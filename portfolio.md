# Career

## WealthKernel 
> (2016 - Present)

[WealthKernel](http://wealthkernel.com) is a fintech startup, based in London. We are a business-to-business wealth management provider.

Here, I am one of the earliest members of the team, helping to build out the platform that will power this startup.

### Challenges

At WK, the daily challenges are; 

#### Managing technical debt

Being as it's a greenfield system, we're aiming to build out the platform as quick as possible. 

This means that we have to take on more debt in certain areas, as well as making sure others are rock solid.

#### Building something which has never been done before

What we're trying to achieve has never been done before. 

A multi-tenant, wealth management platform for other companies to hook into and build on top of to provide wealth management to their clients.

## CommonTime
> (2014 - 2016)

[CommonTime](http://commontime.com) is a company based in Derby. They provide a mobile app development platform as well as bespoke app development.

During my time here, I helped build the Infinity platform.
