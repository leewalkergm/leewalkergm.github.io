title: My Ludum Dare #31 entry!

This weekend, I took part in the Ludum Dare competition!

The theme was: ‘Entire game on one screen’ and for this, I decided to interpret that as “Display all objectives for the ‘entire game on one screen'”.

I ended up making a space game called SpaceGamma, there are 2 reasons I did this:

1. I love space… Like, seriously.
2. I wanted to try out Unity and do some 3D stuff and since space is “easier” than on earth it made sense.

I thought this game turned out pretty well. It’s not much fun (not a lot to do) but I think I’ve started the basis of a really cool game. However, most importantly… I had a tonne of fun!

I learned a LOT about Unity over the weekend and learned a LOT about blender and Gimp.

Here’s a big screenshot:
