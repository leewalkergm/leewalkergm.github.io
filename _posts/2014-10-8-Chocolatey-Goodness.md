I’ve discovered a niche tool today, something rather powerful…

…Chocolate!

And I don’t mean the physical kind! (sorry :[) I mean the apt-get style installer for windows!

This tool provides simple package installation, removal and updating! It even installs itself via a one-line powershell command that you can copy and paste into an elevated command prompt… Now that’s classy

I’ve not really had the opportunity to install many things via this tool yet, because I already had most of what I need. However I can definitely see myself enlisting it for future endeavours and possibly even submitting packages for my own things!
