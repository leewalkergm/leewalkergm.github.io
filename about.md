I'm an all-round developer, meaning that I have had my hand in many pies!

Primarily I'm a web developer, with lots of experience in the ASP.NET (MVC/API) stack. However, I've also used JavaScript (express/Angular) stacks for personal/recent projects!

See some examples of my work here:

#### 2015
- [Global Elitist](http://globalelitist.com/) - Counter-strike strategy planning (Express/Angular || JavaScript)
- [AtPeak](http://globalelitist.com/) - Leadership/management training by an industry veteran (ASP.NET MVC || C#)

#### 2014
- [Gaming Matterz](http://gamingmatterz.com/) - Gaming event management application (ASP.NET MVC/API || C#)

#### 2013
- [Just Memories](http://just-memories.co.uk/) - Local photographer's portfolio website (Django || Python)
- [Ashbourne Clocks](http://ashbourneclocks.co.uk/) - Unique and antique clock collector in Ashbourne (PHP)

### More Information

I love game development! I've used Unity 4/5 a lot, and more recently been playing with Unreal Engine 4
